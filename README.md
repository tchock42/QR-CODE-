HTML and CSS



### What I learned

```css
img{
    max-width: 90%;
    border-radius: 1rem;
}
.codigo{
    display: block;
    margin: 3rem auto 5rem auto;  
}
```
### Continued development

I need to improve my skills, because i feel that I lasted too time in this project.

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web) - This helped me for display block properties.
- [html color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/es/) - I used this for color codes..
